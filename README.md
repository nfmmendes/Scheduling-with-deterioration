# Scheduling with deterioration

This repository contains the code and instances used to produce initial results of paper [Solution methods for scheduling problems with sequence-dependent deterioration and maintenance events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721003726)
The final version of code was implemented in C++, but I don't have it with me. 

The instance files should be put in the subdirectory "/Instances With Deterioration/Instances/"

A instance list file should be created in the directory "/Instances With Deterioration/" with the name instance_list.txt
